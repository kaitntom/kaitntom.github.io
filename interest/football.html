    I grew up with football and have watched it since I was young. I'm a big 
    49ers fan, and I enjoy watching games and highlights. 
    Here’s a quick FAQ about football:

    <tr><td>What is a safety?</td><td>When the defense tackles an offensive player in their own end zone (ball and player must be in the end zone); it is worth two points.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>What is an interception?</td><td>Sometimes referred to a "pick" as well, it is when a defensive player catches a "pass" intended for an offensive receiver.</td></tr>

    <tr><td>What does "first down" mean?</td><td>The offense has four attempts (downs) to advance the ball 10 yards for a new set of downs. Basically, you have 4 tries to go 10 yards for 4 new attempts if successful to go another 10 yards or a get a touchdown. The "first down" is like the first try of the next 4.</td></tr>
